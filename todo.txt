Copying_source.py:
-Get list of all pictures (jpg) and videos (mp4, MTS, mov and 3gp) from given path,
and copy them to new location (photomod_source) with separate subdirectories divided by year. 
Copying can`t change modification time.
-Remove duplicates (report everything).
-Rename all files in 'photomod_source' using unique pattern (CREATION_DATE_TIME_SIZE) taken from metadata. #done for pics) MP4!! use https://exiftool.org

Photomod.py:
-Copy photos from 'photomod_source' to 'photomod_dest' directory (years division subdirs) with renaming files using unique pattern (CREATION_DATE_TIME_SIZE).
-Resize all JPGs in 'photomod_dest' with overriding (do not resize small pictures).
-Rename resized pictures, because size change.

Videomod.py
-Copy videos from 'photomod_source' to 'photomod_dest' directory (years division subdirs) with renaming files using unique pattern (CREATION_DATE_TIME_SIZE).
-Convert all videos in 'photomod_dest' using ffmpeg to given resolution (with saving ratio and orientation).  
-If file starts with 'v' rotate it. 
-Rename converted videos using unique pattern (CREATION_DATE_TIME_SIZE) - size change.

To add:
-Getting creation time from file metadata instead os modification time.
-Add path to 'copying_source.py' as script argument (sys.argv).
-Add logging to txt file.

-Create robot (cron job) that will add and convert all new (dropped from smartphones) pics and vids from given path to destination repository (home media library).
Must store hashes and check if file exists before work.
-Create desktop application (add GUI and options).
